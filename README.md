# Multi-class-Prediction-of-Obesity-Risk

## Description:
This project focuses on predicting obesity risk using multiclass classification techniques. The dataset utilized in this project was generated from a deep learning model trained on the Obesity or Cardiovascular Disease (CVD) risk dataset provided on the Kaggle Playground problem.

## Approach:

1. In this project, I utilize various machine learning techniques for multiclass prediction.
2. I employ various data preprocessing techniques to clean up the data.
3. I utilize various data visualization techniques to gain deeper insights into the dataset.
